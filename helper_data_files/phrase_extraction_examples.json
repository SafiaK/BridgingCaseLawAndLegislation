The Regulator, having satisfied itself that the pre-condition for issuing a penalty have been met has declined the opportunity to consider the evidence and argument put forward on behalf of the Appellant company. It has neither sought confirmation of the facts alleged nor queried their veracity and weight. It has entirely discounted them. The Regulator has been administering this system for over a decade, it has ignored the newness and scale of the company, the possible impact of the extraordinary pandemic on such a small new organisation as well as ignored the statement of the impact of a bereavement. Within a system of bounded rationality it has satisfied itself of the existence of a pre-condition and ignored everything else. The words quoted above (paragraph 8) are a somewhat concerning statement for a Regulator to make and indicates a significant failure to appreciate the function of regulation which is precisely to promote the performance of underlying duties. The Regulator appears satisfied that it is entitled to issue a penalty and views that as sufficient. I am entirely satisfied that this behaviour unambiguously indicates that the Respondent has acted unfairly.",
