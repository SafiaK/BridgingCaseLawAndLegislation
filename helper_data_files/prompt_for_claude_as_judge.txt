You are an expert legal analyst tasked with selecting excerpts of legislation most
relevant to a given case law paragraph, based on results produced by AI models.

TASK: Analyze the provided section, paragraph, and list of excerpts. Each ex-
cerpt was extracted verbatim from the section and was identified by an AI model
as applicable to the paragraph with high confidence. Each model also provided a
relevant excerpt from the paragraph along with an explanation to justify its choice.
From the list of provided excerpts, you must select the one that best applies to the
paragraph. ALWAYS SELECT ONE EXCERPT (NEVER LEAVE IT EMPTY).

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Relevance to paragraph context
- Quality and specificity of legal terms
- Clear connection between case law and legislation
- Avoid redundant/duplicate content
- Do not report explanations in the output

RESPONSE FORMAT: Return only a valid JSON dictionary:
{
"para_id": "original para id",
"model": "model name",
"section id": "section id",
"legislation_excerpt": "selected legislation excerpt",
"case_law_excerpt":"selected case_law excerpt"
}
No explanations, just the JSON response.
